" These are some helpful tips for reformatting code: 

" V=  - select text, then reformat with =
" =   - will correct alignment of code
" ==  - one line; 
" gq  - reformat paragraph
" Options to change how automatic formatting is done:

" :set formatoptions (default "tcq")
"  - t - textwidth
"  - c - comments (plus leader -- see :help comments)
"  - q - allogw 'gq' to work
"  - n - numbered lists
"  - 2 - keep second line indent
"  - 1 - single letter words on next line

" All system-wide defaults are set in $VIMRUNTIME/debian.vim (usually just
" /usr/share/vim/vimcurrent/debian.vim) and sourced by the call to :runtime
" you can find below.  If you wish to change any of those settings, you should
" do it in this file (/etc/vim/vimrc), since debian.vim will be overwritten
" everytime an upgrade of the vim packages is performed.  It is recommended to
" make changes after sourcing debian.vim since it alters the value of the
" 'compatible' option.

" properly set to work with the Vim-related packages available in Debian.
